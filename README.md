# Keylogger

A keylogger, short for keystroke logger, is a type of surveillance technology used to monitor and record each keystroke typed on a computer's keyboard. Keyloggers can be either software-based or hardware-based and are often used by cybercriminals to steal sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal messages. However, they can also be used for legitimate purposes, such as monitoring employee activity or troubleshooting technical issues.

## How It Works

### Software Keyloggers
Software keyloggers are installed on a computer and run in the background, capturing every keystroke made by the user. They can be delivered through malicious downloads, phishing emails, or other forms of malware. Once installed, the keylogger records the keystrokes and sends the data to a remote server controlled by the attacker.

### Hardware Keyloggers
Hardware keyloggers are physical devices that are connected between the keyboard and the computer. They capture keystrokes directly from the keyboard before they reach the computer. These devices are often small and inconspicuous, making them difficult to detect without a thorough inspection of the hardware.

## How It Is Useful in Cybersecurity

Keyloggers play a significant role in cybersecurity, both as a threat and as a tool for protection. On the one hand, keyloggers are a major security threat because they can capture sensitive information without the user's knowledge, leading to identity theft, financial loss, and other cybercrimes. On the other hand, keyloggers can be used by cybersecurity professionals to monitor and analyze user behavior, detect suspicious activity, and improve security measures. By understanding how keyloggers work and implementing robust security practices, organizations can better protect their systems and data from unauthorized access.
